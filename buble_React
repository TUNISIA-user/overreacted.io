Bubble React itself isn't a standard or recognized term in web development, so there might be some confusion or a misunderstanding here. However, I can provide definitions related to React and Bubble in different contexts:

1. React (React.js)
React is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where dynamic, complex UI updates are needed. It allows developers to build reusable UI components and manage the view layer of web applications. React follows a component-based architecture and uses a virtual DOM for efficient rendering.

2. Bubble (in General)
Bubble often refers to a no-code development platform that enables users to build web applications without having to write code manually. It provides a visual interface for designing the front-end and handling back-end logic. It's popular for prototyping and building full-featured web applications without traditional programming knowledge.

Possible Combinations:
If you're referring to a concept like "React Bubble Component," it might relate to UI elements such as chat bubbles or tooltip components made with React.
If you mean a blend of Bubble.io and React, developers sometimes use React alongside Bubble to extend the customization and functionality of apps initially built with Bubble
